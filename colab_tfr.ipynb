First is that ranking all documents in the corpus can take a very long time. For this corpus it can take approximately 24 hrs or more. The second is that NCDG of the results generated when using the full corpus is very low but re-ranking the outputs of another rankers predictions generates more accurate results than the previous ranker and runs quickly.\r\n",
